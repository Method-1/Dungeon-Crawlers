Dungeon Crawler
===============

Welcome to Dungeon Crawler!

The goal of this game is to fight your way through the dungeon and
collect as much treasure as you can doing so. But be careful! There
are monsters lurking in the shadows...



Starting the game
=================

When you start the game, you will be presented with a few choices.
Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Choose either a new character or load a saved one.
2. If you chose to make a new one, you will be able to choose a
   class and also name your character.
3. Choose the map size you want
4. Choose which corner to start in
5. Now start your adventure!


How to play
===========

Once you start, you will be presented with the map. You will see
two markers; S and E. These represent the beginning, S, and the end
E. The end will always be on the opposite side of the map.

To move, you use the keyboard:
W - Up
A - Left
S - Down
D - Right

This is the classic keyboard layout aptly named the WASD-style.
You can move room to room by pressing each direction and then hit
Enter.

Each time you move to a room, you will have a chance at finding 
treasure and facing no, one or more monsters.

If you're facing monsters, you will have two choices: Fight or 
Flee!

Should you choose to flee and are successful in doing so, you will
move to the previous room and forfeit the potential treasures in
doing so.

However,

if you choose to fight, you will have to beat however many monsters
there are and are then rewarded with the treasures in the room!


Fight or Flight
===============

The fighting is simple turn-based combat. Each character class and
each type of monster have different stats (health points, stamina, etc).
Each turn there's a dice roll determining who is to hit first. After this
there's another roll to see if you hit the monster or if they hit you.

Depending on these stats you will either fare well in the fight, or
have more of challenge.

Should you be defeated in battle, you will not be able to collect the
treasure in that room, but you will tally your total collected treasure
thus far which will be saved on your character.

Fleeing works by rolling the dice and comparing your stamina to the
monsters. Each time you fail to flee, you will get hit by the monster
you're facing!


Treasures and Highscore
=======================

There are five types of treasures to collect, each worth different 
amounts of points:

1.  2 - Coins
2.  6 - Moneypouch
3. 10 - Gold necklace
4. 14 - Gems
5. 20 - Small treasurechest

The treasures you collect either by finding them in a room with no
monsters or after defeating monsters will get tallied up to your total
which gets saved to your characters score.

When you finish the game, exit or die, your character will have it's 
total points saved and those can later be looked at on the score board
by accessing it via the menu.
